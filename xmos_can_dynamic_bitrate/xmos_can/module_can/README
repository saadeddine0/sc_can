GETTING STARTED
---------------

The CAN controller is virtually all contained within the CanPhy.xc source file.
There are a points it is worth noting:

  * The CAN PHY thread requires 100MIPS to run correctly. It is therefore
    currently not possible to have more than 4 threads active on the core with
    the PHY.
  * The CAN PHY thread is given packets to send over a channel. It sends
    valid packets it has received over a channel. These channel transactions
    need to not pause in order for the CAN PHY to continue to function 
    correctly.
